-- Revised by Tim Catania

Below you'll find the original README created by Griffin Adams. 
I have taken his work and updated it so that it will work with Graphics 2.0.
Main changes were removing the "setReferencePoint" sections to and setting them as "anchorpoints".
Please feel free to correct any issues you find in the adjusted code.

Thanks!

 Thanks to Brent Sorrentino for a great parallax demo, the
  the starting point from witch this class was born.

 INFORMATION
====================================================================


 * Import the class like this:

   parallax = require( "parallax" )


 * To create a new scene

   yourScene = parallax.newScene(
		{
			width = [X SCENE SIZE],
			height = [Y SCENE SIZE],
			left = [SCENE X BEGINNING POS],
			top = [SCENE Y BEGINNING POS],
			[repeated = [REPEAT FOREVER, "horizontal","vertical","both"]
		} )


 * To add a new layer to the scene

   yourScene:newLayer(
		{
			image = [IMAGE NAME],
			width = [IMAGE WIDTH],
			height = [IMAGE HEIGHT],
			[top = [IMAGE Y POS],]
            [bottom = [IMAGE Y POS],]
			left = [IMAGE X POS],
			speed = [HOW FAST, 0 - 1 for backgrounds, > 1 for foregrounds],
			[repeated = [INF SCROLL, "horizontal","vertical","both"]]
		} )

 NOTE: Create your layers in order from closest to farthest away
 NOTE: All x/y coordinates should be in relation to the screen (not local)


 * To add objects to a layer

   yourScene:insertObj( object, [layer] )

 NOTE: If no layer specified, defaults to the top layer
 


 * To move a scene

   yourScene:move( deltaX, deltaY )
